# Social-Media-Scanner
Commissioned project made to automatically gather data of Instagram social media posts.

This program automatically scans through a profile of Instagram and finds each post a specified account has recently posted.
After scanning for each post, it goes through each post and strips the HTML data that is needed from them.
It also saves the image of the post.

It saves the output of the program as an excel spreadsheet with a bunch of different pieces of information not normally seen by users.
Most importantly, it saves the accessibility option, secret data about the post used by bots in order to share it.

Some interesting pieces of data it can scrape are:
 - Location the post was made in.
 - If the post is an advertisment.
 - Username of the poster.
 - Exactly when the post was uploaded.
 - The text attached to the post.
 - The accessiblity text.
 - Tagged users.
 - The URL.
